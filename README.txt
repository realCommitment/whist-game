The task was to design and improve on the innovative Whist card game that has been setup by New, Exciting, and Revolutionary Designer Games (NERD Games). The new features will expand on their design to allow for greater configurability and include new NPC players to play against. At the same time, these additional features must expect to have even further game additions in the future, so therefore, they will need to be implemented in a way that allows for easier extensions of the game in the future.
Before working on the code, drawing up a Domain Class Diagram was an important first step that allowed us to get a good idea of how we wish to implement the code and decide which classes should be talking to each other. From the Domain Diagram, we built a Design Class Diagram which would include all the links that we wanted from the Domain whilst also including in software concepts. From the Design model we could see that there were classes that could be split and relationships that could be redirected, when thinking about the design patterns. This report will look through the discussions of adding or modifying features through design patterns to allow for a better and highly configurable code.
